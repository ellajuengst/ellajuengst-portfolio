                <h2>Welcome to my portfolio site. Here, I will discuss how I took on this project and what tools I used
                    when creating it. As for my motivatoin, I created this site as place to showcase my skills in both
                    coding and design. I first designed and prototyped the site in Adobe XD, and you can check out my design process 
                    <a href="/design/my-website-design.html">here</a>. I wanted the site to be more interesting and creative than your typical
                    Bootstrap site, so I decided to build my site using the built-in/customizable CSS grid and created my own UI elements. 
                    I utilized HTML5, CSS3/SASS, and JavaScript to make my site fully functional and responsive.

                <h1 class="sub">goals</h1>
                <h2>The goal of my site is to provide easy access to my design and development projects for employers, friends, and anyone else interested in viewing my 
                    work. I would achieve this through create a simple but unique navigation, a clean layout and design for each page, and a fully responsive site
                    that can be viewed on any device (phone, computer, or tablet).
                </h2>
                
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">development</h1>
                <h2>I programmed the site using "Mobile-first" principles. Using SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), I create variables
                    to represent each breakpoint and referenced these variables throughout the rest of my CSS code to change the layouts for both 
                    tablet and desktop viewing. I created unique CSS grids for each page on my site.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I used JavaScript to create a functional navigation menu, that also changes its layout on different devices. I created my navigation in its 
                    own HTML file, in order to utilize a global navigation (making edits and changes much more efficient). This file is linked to the other files using JavaScript.
