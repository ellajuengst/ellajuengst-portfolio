                <h2>I recently redesigned the UNC Pleiades' site in Adobe XD (to be implemented in code soon!). Feel free to check
                    out my updated design <a href="/design/unc-pleaides.html">here</a>! Read on to learn more about how I built the site.

                <h2>This site was built for Pleiades, the women’s club ultimate frisbee team at UNC Chapel 
                    Hill. Pleiades has been on UNC’s campus since 1993, and until now, the team has not had 
                    a working website. The website’s goal is to provide information on the team for prospective
                     players, fans, and family members.

                <h1 class="sub">progression</h1>
                <h2>The original version of this site was constructed by myself as well as three other group members (Salma Samih, Joshua Chung, Alexis Gaviola) for a class project. Credit goes to these individuals for contributing to the original design and structure of the site. Since then, I have made updates to the design and layout of the site, in order to improve the user experience and interface. This includes an entire revamp of the once “Photos” page, which contained 12 static image html elements with no interaction capabilities. Now, the “Media” page allows users to view all of Pleiades photos and videos from the past two years, by simply following the link of their choice.  </h2>

                <h1 class="sub">goals</h1>
                <h2>As a group, we made three goals to keep our project focused and directed. We wanted the finished site to: allow users to get the information they need within 5 minutes, possess an easily read menu, and we wanted it all to be unified with an attractive, meaningful, and coherent design. </h2>

                <h1 class="sub">design palette</h1>
                <h2>In terms of the design, we began by prototyping the site using Adobe XD, in order to construct our layouts and styling before moving into code. We liked the astronomic associations of the Pleiades name, so we wanted to move forward with designs based around stars and constellations, while still conveying Pleiades’ fun, competitive spirit. We also utilized an argyle pattern because the argyle pattern is a common motif used in UNC athletic brands. The color palette includes a “Carolina blue” theme in order to appeal to prospective UNC students and connect the team to the school. The design palette and UI elements can be seen below:
