                    The problem: If I want to know the score of semis at college ultimate frisbee nationals from 
                    2013, that info is pretty hard to find. How do we solve this?

                    <br>
                    UltiDB is a community run, crowdsourced, wiki-style site for the 
                    sport of Ultimate frisbee. Users can easily search for and retrieve historical 
                    tournament and team data through an intuitive and friendly user interface.

                <h2>
                    Our backend will include a Django Rest Framework (DRF) serving data through REST API. We will implement
                    a web scraper to pull data from USA Ultimate, twitter, etc. Finally,
                    we will have a user interface for the scraper and maintain a Content Management System (CMS).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our database architecture will involve models representing teams, tournaments, players, seasons, games,
                    and coaches.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our frontend will be a React application that pulls data from the DRF. It will involve a beautiful, simple design 
                    that allows users to easily and quickly find the information they need.

                    with a team of four with three of my fellow peers. We will be working on this site throughout the fall, and we hope
                    to have our first release sometime in the next two months. When the site is up and running, I will post a link on
                    this page! Check back soon!
