            <h1>about</h1>
            <h2>I grew up in Arlington, Virginia and graduated from H-B Woodlawn Secondary Program in 2018. 
                I am currently studying at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, pursuing a BS in 
                Computer Science with a minor in Studio Art. My expected graduation date is May 2022. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have always been passionate about art and design, and I grew up taking many art courses in and 
                outside of school. I have studied color theory, figure drawing, and principles of design. I love 
                working with both traditional and digital mediums. I have experience in Adobe Creative Cloud applications 
                including Photoshop, Illustrator, and XD. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my whole life, I have also loved using critical thinking to solve mathematical problems. 
                Since I came to college, I have discovered my interest in computer science. In terms of programming 
                languages, I have experience in Java, HTML5/CSS3/Sass, Bootstrap, TypeScript, C, and Assembly. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I believe the two subjects are intrinsically similarâ€”the methodical details of design and 
                the innovative creativity of science. I have discovered there are many outlets that allow me to 
                combine my eye for design with my problem solving and technical skills. I am continuing to expand my 
                interest and knowledge regarding the intersection of these two fields by studying and practicing web 
                development and UX/UI design.
