            <h1>about</h1>
            <h2>I grew up in Arlington, Virginia and graduated from H-B Woodlawn Secondary Program in 2018. 
                I am currently studying at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, pursuing a BS in 
                Computer Science with a minor in Advertising and PR. My expected graduation date is May 2022.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my whole life, I have loved using critical thinking to solve mathematical problems. 
                Since I came to college, I have discovered my interest in computer science. I have strong problem solving skills and a natural
                curiosity to learn new technologies. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have also always been passionate about design, and I grew up taking many art courses in and 
                outside of school. I have studied color theory, user experience, and principles of design. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I believe design and computer science are intrinsically similarâ€”the methodical details of design and 
                the innovative creativity of science. I have discovered there are many outlets that allow me to 
                combine my eye for design with my problem solving and technical skills. I am continuing to expand my 
                interest and knowledge regarding the intersection of these two fields by studying and practicing web 
                development and UX/UI design.
