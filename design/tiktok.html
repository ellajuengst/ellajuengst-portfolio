                <h1 class="sub">motivation and criteria</h1>
                <h2>This semester, I am taking a course on interactive media. For a project, we were asked to redesign TikTok's video 
                    bookmarking capability. We were asked to make functionality more user friendly and accessible, while using at least two of the UX principles: 
                    contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. Below I discuss how I used each prinicple to enhance the bookmarking feature. The mockups were created in Adobe XD, using elements
                    that I designed in Adobe Illustrator (many of which were based off of TikTok's current UI palette).
                </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">contrast</h1>
                <h2>I used contrast to differentiate between the app navigation and the video navigation 
                    on the home page. The app (bottom) navigation has icons that are not filled in (except 
                    for the active page), and the video navigation (right) has icons that include fill color. This 
                    contrast will help the user differentiate between the two navigations. I also use contrast
                     when a user clicks on either the like button or the bookmark button. When selected, these 
                     buttons turn a pink/red color, which contrasts greatly with their default fill colors.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">alignment</h1>
                <h2>I used alignment to make sure the elements were all correctly spaced. The top of the 
                    profile image aligns with the top of the “like” button, in order to keep all the buttons 
                    in a relatively small rectangle at the bottom of the video. There are equal margins 
                    around all of the elements, which centers everything on the page. In the “video menu,” 
                    associated with the three dots on the home page, all of the content inside is aligned 
                    with each other and has equal margins. Additionally, on the homepage I used alignment 
                    to center the text inside both the “like” and “comment” buttons.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">proximity</h1>
                <h2>I used proximity to reformat the interface by grouping together related elements. 
                    On the home page, I moved the profile image icon next to the username since they are 
                    both associated with the creator of the video. I got rid of the sound “record” symbol 
                    because I felt it was unnecessary and was clogging space. I grouped all the music/sound 
                    related elements in the bottom left corner below the user information and caption. The 
                    app navigation remains at the bottom in a group. The video interaction navigation is 
                    grouped in the bottom right hand side. This way, the user interface is clearly divided 
                    into four sections which would make it easier for the viewer to know where to look when 
                    wanting to take a specific action. On the profile page, I moved the current bookmark page 
                    button to the navigation which has the users videos, likes, and private content, since I 
                    felt it was out of place next to the edit profile button. This way all of the links to the 
                    user’s videos are grouped in a four column navigation.
                </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">ux layouts</h1>
                <h2>Overall, I think my redesign decreased the amount of space taken up on the homepage and implements a bookmark functionality that is much more accessible and obvious. 
                    I would love for you to check out my protoyped wire frames made with Adobe XD. You can find them <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/3e0314f2-4294-4239-9c5e-831b3aa6f0b6-6b50/?fullscreen" target="_blank">here</a>.
