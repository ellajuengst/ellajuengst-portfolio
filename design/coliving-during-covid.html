                <h1 class="sub">Background</h1>
                <h2>I designed this app as a project for my course titled UX Strategy and Design. It will not be developed, but it served as an exercise in UX strategy.
                </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">Overview</h1>
                <h2>This app helps college students find roommates who share similar opinions regarding COVID-19 safety protocols. With their new or current roommates, users can build and customize contracts from recommended templates.</h2>
                
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">Experience-based Problem</h1>
                <h2>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, my housemates and I have struggled to discuss and create mutually agreed upon rules regarding social distancing and COVID-19 precautions. With many different comfort levels regarding risk, arguments can easily occur. Beyond negotiating with current housemates, I know many students who have struggled to find new roommates who practice similar COVID safety protocols.</h2>
               
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">Question</h1>
                <h2><em>How can we manage and maintain healthy relationships when individuals (sharing a living space) have different opinions or comfort levels regarding COVID safety measures and risk?</em></h2>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">UX Strategy</h1>
                <h2>The purpose of this app is to streamline the process of communicating one’s COVID safety preferences when searching for a new roommate, and it also serves as a place to build safety agreements between current housemates. The app not only provides a safer environment for college students to find a new roommate, but it also removes the need to ask uncomfortable questions. 
                </h2>
                <h2>When building their profile, users must confirm they have read and understood the CDC guidelines, as the app does not endorse any behavior that conflicts with the CDC recommendations. Users then complete a “Personal Risk Evaluation” to determine if they have any preexisting conditions, and a “Comfort Assessment,” to determine their risk tolerance. As everyone has different levels of comfort, users will use a slider to select where exactly they fall on the spectrum from “Not at All Comfortable” to “Totally Comfortable” for activities with varying levels of exposure risk.
                </h2>
                <h2>After submitting their information, users will be placed into one of three categories: Low, Medium, and High Risk Tolerance. An individual’s Risk Tolerance is indicated on their public profile, so other users can find people with similar comfort levels in the search pages.
                </h2>
                <h2>The contract building section of the app uses the information from the users’ initial surveys to create a baseline contract that compromises between each user's responses. If users have different ideas regarding safety, the app will tend to favor users with lower risk tolerance when creating the contract. Users can edit their generated contract to more specifically fit their needs by adding, removing, or changing guidelines. </h2>

                <h1 class="sub">Business Strategy: Customer Segment</h1>
                <h2>Research suggests that this app would be used by college students who are currently struggling to navigate relationships within their living situation or are looking for new roommates during the COVID-19 pandemic. It targets individuals who may have differing opinions about COVID-19 safety measures from their roommates or those struggle to initiate uncomfortable conversations. 
                </h2>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">Business Strategy: Value Proposition</h1>
                <h2>This app looks to ease social and health related stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic through streamlining communication about safety and quarantine guidelines within households and helping users find new roommates with similar tolerances of risk.
                </h2>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">Business Strategy: Competitive Analysis</h1>
                <h2><em>Facebook</em></h2>
                <h2>Facebook Groups provide a platform for college students to connect with classmates to find potential roommates. It allows for easy messaging, and it also includes the benefit of tagging other users in posts. However, Facebook Groups were not designed for the purpose of connecting roommates, so there are no specialized tools. While users may sometimes mention their preferred COVID-19 safety measures, there is no contract builder or user matching based on risk tolerance.
                </h2>

                <h2><em>Roomster</em></h2>
                <h2>Roomster is an app that allows users to search for houses, rooms, and roommates in a particular area. The app provides LinkedIn verification of other users. However, it is not specific to university students which could pose some safety risks for college students looking for another person to live with. There is also no reference to COVID-19 safety measures or way to specify one’s preferences. 
                </h2>

                <h2><em>Roomi</em></h2>
                <h2>Roomi is also an app that allows users to look for both potential roommates and rooms to rent. It provides the price ranges of other users so a user knows if someone would be a good financial match for them. It also provides roommate preferences such as cleaning, smoking, and guests. However, similar to Roomster, there is no place to specify preferences regarding COVID-19 protocols.</h2>
