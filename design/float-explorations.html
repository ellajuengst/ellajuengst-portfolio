                <h2>I am currently interning at <a href="https://www.floatup.co/" target="_blank">Float</a>, a company aiming to connect hosts with renters looking for monthly parking. 
                    As a UX/UI intern, I am working to redesign the entire website interface, to create a more appealing and user friendly experience for Float's customers. I am working with
                    another intern Krupa Patel, and we are currently conducting user research and in the process of building out the site as low fidelity wireframes. We are constructing the information architecture
                    and adding many features to our designs that are not incorporated in the current site. Our goal is to prioritize the user and generate a design that 
                    is efficient and memorable for both renters and hosts using the site. Later this fall, I will be updating my site with
                    a case study detailing the entire UX process. For the UI, we have created a variety of explorations and elements to help build a concrete brand for Float,
                    and I thought I would share these as a precursor to the final UX designs.

                    The following are a few logo explorations I created. I utilized different aspects of Float's product (i.e. clouds, location, sharing, driving, cars) to create some new ideas that
                    still reflect the style and identity of the company.

                    The following is an illustration I created in Adobe Illustrator for Float's pitch deck. I wanted to show a city skyline but also create something more 
                    unique than the typical 2-D vector graphic. I used the Extrude and Bevel tool to create the 3-D elements. This illustration would be displayed in the Mission Statement slide of the deck, with a description 
                    of how to company plans to expand in the future.
