                <h2>Last fall, I made a website for Pleiades (UNC Chapel Hill's women's club ultimate team) for a class group project. The site was
                    designed using Adobe XD, and it was what I thought at the time was a solid UX/UI interface. However, I've learned 
                    a lot since the first creation of the site. Therefore, I decided to revamp the site in order for it to reflect my current skills set and 
                    current trends.
                </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h1 class="sub">changes</h1>
                <h2>I kept the same overall structure and architecture of the site, as it works well. The problems were in the outdated visual interface. The original site can be viewed <a href="http://www.uncpleiades.com/" target="_blank">here</a> (as I have not yet
                    updated and pushed the code to reflect the design changes). I almost entirely changed the user interface to reflect a more modern version of the site. I updated the navigation menu to reflect current trends by getting
                    rid of the navbar itself, and leaving just the text elements with hover/active capabilities. I made the home page background image the full height and width, in order to get rid of the outdated borders.
                    I removed the argyle background on all the pages which, although was a great link to UNC Sports, I felt made the site more cramped and busy. I changed the secondary font to Avenir, one of the most popular sans sarif fonts of 2020. 
                    Finally, I made some other smaller changes and finishing touches to the layouts and elements on each page, in order to reflect the new style.
